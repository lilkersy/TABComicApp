# TABComicApp

An Android Mobile Application developed to consume the marvel API.

The application was developed using Android Studio 2.2 and uses the Retrofit Library to consume the Marvel API.

The Retrofit documentation can be found in https://square.github.io/retrofit/

Retrofit can be said to do for Restful Web Services (or even SOAP) what wsimport does for SOAP Web services.

What can be implemented in next version of this app.

1. Ability to store data in an in-app database say Sqlite.
2. Improve on the Algorithm that gets the comics for a given budget 
(right now, the maximum budget that you can searched with is 250).
But I will implement the solution better if given time by breaking the the
budget into chunks and getting the comics that will fit in any given 
chunk while considering the previos chunks while considering the Big O Notation 
of the data types i will use.
3. Improve more on the UI, like have a paralax app bar, with the search button on the app bar.
4. Have an uto complete in the search field to get the previous budget searches.
5.
